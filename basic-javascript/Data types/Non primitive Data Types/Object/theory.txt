an object is a dynamic data structure that stores related data as key-value pair where each key uniquely identifies its value 
the values of properties can be primitive , object , function (known as methods when defined inside a object )
objects are mutable and dynamic properties can be added , modified , or deleted at any time 
objects allow data grouping and encapsulation , making it easier to manage related information and behaviour together 

2 primary ways to create object in javascript :-
1)creation using object literals :-
the object literal syntax allows you to define and initialize an object withcurly braces {} setting properties as key-value pair 

let obj={
	name:'Vaibhav',
	age:27,
	job:'Developer,
}

2)creation using new Object() Constructor :-
let obj = new Object();
obj.name='vaibhav';
obj.age=23;
obj.job='tester,
