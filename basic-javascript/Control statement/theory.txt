javascript control statement is used to control the execution of the programm based on a specific condition 
if the condition meets then a particular block of action will be executed otherwise it will execute another block of action that satisfies that particular condition 

types of control statement in javascript 
conditional statement :- these statements are used for decision-making , a decision 
n is made by the conditional statement based on an expression that is passed. Either YES or NO.
iterative statement:- this is statement that iterates repeatedly until a condition is met. Simply said  , if we have an expression , the statement will keep repeating itself until an unless it is satisfied.


approach :- if statement
in this approach , we are using an if statement to check a specific condition , the code block get executed when the given condition is satisfied 
if(condition_is_given_here){
	//if condition is met , 
	//the code will get executed 
}



if-else approach :-
the if-else statement will perform some action for specific condition if the condition meets then a particular code of action will be executed otherwise it will execute another cod of action that satisfies that particular condition 
if(conditon_1){
	//executes when condition_1 true
	if(condition_2){
		//exectes when condition_2 is true
	}
}

if(condition){
	//executes when condition is true
} else {
	//executes when condition is false 
}



approach 3:- switch statement
the switch case statement is javascript also used for decision-making purposes. in some cases using the switch case statement is seen to be more convinent than if-else statements
switch(expression){
	case value1:
	     statement1;
		 break;
    case value2:
		 statement2;
		 break;
	.
	.
	.
	.
	case valueN:
		 statementN;
		 break;
	default:
	    statementDefault;	 
}



approach 4 : using the ternary operator (conditionl operator)
the conditonal operator , also referred to as the ternary operator (? : ) , is s shortcut for expressing conditional statements in javascript

syntax :- conditon ? value if true : value if false

approach 1 using for loop :-
in this approach we are usign for lop in which the execution of set of instruction repeatedly until some condition evalutes and becomes false 
for (statement1;statement2;statement3){
  // code here .....
}


using while loop :-
while (conditon){
   //code block 
}


usign do while-loop :- 
the do while loop is similar to the while loop , except that the condition is evaluted after the execution of the loop body 
this means the code block will execute at least once , even if the condition is false .
