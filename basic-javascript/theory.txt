javascript is a language or technology that we use to create websites 
e.g youtube.com , amazooon.com 

main 3 technology we used to create website 
html , css , javascript 
html :- structure of website (content  e.g buttons , images , text )
css : - appearence of website (adding colors , and beauty)
javascript : makes website interactive (do somwthing)


javascipt :- is basically giving instructions to computer and the computer follows our instructions

javascript is versitle , dynamically typed programming language that brings life to web pages by making them interactive
used for building interactive web application , supports both client side and server side rendering development 
object-oriented , platform independent , update html using dom capable of exception handling , allos anonymous function 

javascript is single-threaded language that executes the code line by line 
the data type of variable is decided at run-tim in javascript, which is why it is called dynamically typed 

keyfeatures of javascript:-
cliend side scripting :- it runs on users browser so has faster response timw without needing to communicate with server 
versatile: -can be used for a wide range of tasks . from simple cal to complex server-side application 
event-driven : responds to user actions (clicks , keystrokes ) in real-time 
asynchrorous :-it can handle tasks like fetching data from servers without freezing the user interface 
rich ecosystem :- there are numerous lib and framework build on javascript such as react , angular vue.js makes web dev faster and more efficient 


client-side :- 
involves controlling the browser and its dom (Document object model)
handles user events like clicks and form inputs 
common lib include angular , react , vue

server-side :-
involves interacting with database , manipulating files , generating responses 
node js and framework like express are widely used for server-side javascript , enabling full stack dev.


javascript supports both imperative and declarative styles :-
imperative programming :- 
focuses on how to perform tasks by controlling the flow of computation. this includes approach like procedural and objet-oriented programming, often using costructs like async/await to handle asynchrornous actions.
declarative programming :-focuses on what should be done rather than how its done , it emphasizes describing the desired result such as with arrow funtion , without detailing the steps to achieve it 

limitaions of javascript :-
security risks
performance 
complexity 
weak error handling and type checking
