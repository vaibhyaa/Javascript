// variables and data types are foundational concepts in programming, serving as building blocks for storing and manipulating information within programm 

// data types in javascript :-
// primitives data types :-
// (numeric type):-number and bigint
// (non-numeric type) :- string , boolean , null , undefined , symbol 

// non-primitives data types :- object , arrays , funciton , data object , regular expression 


// what is variable:-
// it is like a container that holds data can be reused or updated later in the programm 
// variables are declarted using the keywords ver , let const 

// declaing varibles in javascript :-
before ES6(2015):- Varibles were declared  only with var which is function -scoped and global - scoped , causing issues like hoisting and blobal pollution,
Es6 introduction : let and const intruduced to provide safer alternatives for declaing varibles 
scope :- let ad const are blocked-scoped (limited to {} block ) or global-scoped , reducing error compared to var
