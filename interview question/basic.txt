1)what are the possible ways to create object in javascript ?
:- there are many ways to create objects in javascript :-
object literal ,object constructor ,object create method ,function constructor with prototype , object assign method, ES6 class sntax , singleton pattern
main this two:-
---)object literal:- 
const obj={
	name:'vaibhav',
	phoneNo:1234567890,
}
object literal property values can be of any data type , including array , functions , nested object

---)object constructor:-
const obj=new Object();
obj.name='vaibhav';
obj['job-profile']='software engineer';



2)what is prototype chain :-
It is a core concept of javascript inheritance model. It allows object to inherit properties and methods from other object 
the prototype chain enables inheritance in javascript. If a property isnt found on an object , javascript looks up its prototype chain . The prototype of an object instance can be accessed with Object.getPrototypeOf(obj) or _proto_.
the prototype of a constructor function is available via Constructor.prototype 
the chain ends when the prototype is null. 


IMP:-3)What is the difference between call , apply , bind ?
this are the methods which allows you to controls the context(this value) in which a function is executed.
purpose is simliar :- they differ in how they handle arguments and when the function is invoked 
call :- the call() methods invokes a function immediately , allowing you to specify the value of this and pass arguments individullay (comma-seperator ) 
apply:- the apply() method is similar to call() , but it takes the function arguments as an array (or array-like-object) instead of individual argumenst 
bind():-
the bind() method creates a new function with specific this value and , optionally , preset initial arguments 
unlike call and apply , bind does not immediately invoke the function : instead , it returns a new function that you can call later 
points)call and apply are almost interchangeble ; both invoke the function immediately , but differ in how arguments are passed 
binds down not execute the function immediately . instead it creates a new function with the spefified this value and optional arguments , which can be called later 
use call or apply when you want to immediately invoke a function with specific this context . use bind when you want to create a new function with specific this context to be invoked later 


4)what is json and its common operations :-
JSON(javascript object notation ) is a lightweight , text-based data format that uses javascript object syntax for structuring data . It was popularized by Douglas Crocford and is widely used for transmitting data between a server and client in web application
